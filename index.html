										Open source software has the potential to be very secure. Unlike proprietary code that can only be accessed directly by its own developers, anyone can vet open source projects to spot flaws and bugs. In practice, though, being open source is no panacea. Now, code repository GitHub is rolling out new tools for its GitHub Advanced Security suite that will make it easier to root out vulnerabilities in the open source projects managed on its platform. Open source code present a few security challenges. In practice there aren't always enough people with the right expertise looking at it. And open source projects are generally ad hoc; they don't necessarily have a clear process in place for people to submit vulnerabilities, or the resources available for someone to patch them. Even if you surmount those hurdles, you may not know who's actually using your open source code and needs a patch. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/github-advanced-security-open-source/">[Read More]</a>

										Adobe just announced that it is acquiring marketing workflow management startup Workfront for $1.5 billion. Bloomberg first reported the sale earlier today. Workfront  was founded back in 2001, making it a bit long in the tooth for a private company that has raised $375 million, according to Crunchbase. It’s worth noting that $280 million of that was secondary money raised last year. The acquisition gives Adobe more online marketing tooling to fit into its Experience Cloud. This one helps companies manage complex projects inside the marketing department. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/adobe-acquires-marketing-workflow-startup-workfront-for-1-5b/">[Read More]</a>

										India’s antitrust watchdog has opened an investigation into Google  for allegedly abusing the dominant position of its app store to promote its payments service in the world’s second largest internet market.	In its Monday announcement (PDF) about opening an antitrust case against Google, Indian watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) said it is directing an in-depth investigation into the claims of whether the Android maker prominently promotes Google Pay during the setup of an Android smartphone (and whether phone vendors have a choice to avoid this); and if Play Store’s billing system is designed “to the disadvantage of both i.e. apps facilitating payment through UPI, as well as users.” The informant, who has not been identified, alleged that in addition to Google Play Store’s billing system favoring Google Pay app, in-app purchases for apps downloaded through Play Store are also mandated to support Google Pay service “if they want to be listed on the Play Store” and they are required to pay a “high commission” for that. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/india-opens-antitrust-case-against-google-over-its-payments-app/">[Read More]</a>
